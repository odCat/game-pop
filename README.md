# Why

# What was learned and practiced

* Learnt to use the **pytest** testing framework for unit/integration testing.<br>
In the past I used **unittest** for my testing needs, and it was enough. But<br>
during an interview I was asked if I knew **pytest**, since that was what they<br>
were using. After reading about it, I decided it is worth switching over.<br><br>
And here we are, this being my first project using **pytest**.<br>
 
* How to call **SQLite** from Python;<br><br>
The project needed a DBMS. After a short consideration, I decided something<br>
lite is perfect for it. To interface with the DBMS, the **sqlite3** module is imported.<br>
Using this API is also a first.
